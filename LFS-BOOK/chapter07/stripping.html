        The libtool .la files are only useful when linking with static
        libraries. They are unneeded, and potentially harmful, when using
        dynamic shared libraries, specially when using non-autotools build
        systems. While still in chroot, remove those files now:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">find /usr/{lib,libexec} -name \*.la -delete</kbd>
</pre>
      <p>
        Remove the documentation of the temporary tools, to prevent them from
        ending up in the final system, and save about 35 MB:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">rm -rf /usr/share/{info,man,doc}/*</kbd>
</pre>
      <div class="admon note">

          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          All the remaining steps in this section are optional. Nevertheless,
          as soon as you begin installing packages in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>,
          the temporary tools will be overwritten. So it may be a good idea
          to do a backup of the temporary tools as described below. The other
          steps are only needed if you are really short on disk space.
        </p>

        The following steps are performed from outside the chroot
        environment. That means, you have to leave the chroot environment
        first before continuing. The reason for that is to:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              make sure that objects are not in use while they are
              manipulated.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              get access to file system locations outside of the chroot
              environment to store/read the backup archive which should not
              be placed within the <code class="filename">$LFS</code>
              hierarchy for safety reasons.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Leave the chroot environment and unmount the kernel virtual file
        systems:

        <p>
          All of the following instructions are executed by <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code>. Take extra care about the commands you're
          going to run as mistakes here can modify your host system. Be aware
          that the environment variable <code class="envar">LFS</code> is set
          for user <code class="systemitem">lfs</code> by default but it
          might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be set for
          <code class="systemitem">root</code>. Whenever commands are to be
          executed by <code class="systemitem">root</code>, make sure you
          have set <code class="envar">LFS</code> accordingly. This has been
          discussed in <a class="xref" href="../chapter02/aboutlfs.html"
          title="2.6.&nbsp;Setting The $LFS Variable">Section&nbsp;2.6,

          7.14.1. Stripping
        </h2>
        <p>
          If the LFS partition is rather small, it is good to know that
          unnecessary items can be removed. The executables and libraries
          built so far contain a little over 90 MB of unneeded debugging
          symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strip off debugging symbols from binaries:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">strip --strip-debug $LFS/usr/lib/*
strip --strip-unneeded $LFS/usr/{,s}bin/*
strip --strip-unneeded $LFS/tools/bin/*</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          These commands will skip a number of files reporting that it does
          not recognize their file format. Most of these are scripts instead
          of binaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> to use
          <em class="parameter"><code>--strip-unneeded</code></em> on the
          libraries. The static ones would be destroyed and the toolchain
          packages would need to be built all over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you should have at least 5 GB of free space on the
          chroot partition that can be used to build and install Glibc and
          GCC in the next phase. If you can build and install Glibc, you can
          build and install the rest too. You can check the free disk space
          with the command <span class="command"><strong>df -h
          $LFS</strong></span>.
        </p>

          7.14.2. Backup
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now that the essential tools have been created, its time to think
          about a backup. When every check has passed successfully in the
          previously built packages, your temporary tools are in a good state
          and might be backed up for later reuse. In case of fatal failures
          in the subsequent chapters, it often turns out that removing
          everything and starting over (more carefully) is the best option to
          recover. Unfortunately, all the temporary tools will be removed,
          too. To avoid spending extra time to redo something which has been
          built successfully, prepare a backup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you have at least 600 MB free disk space (the source
          tarballs will be included in the backup archive) in the home
          directory of user <code class="systemitem">root</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create the backup archive by running the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cd $LFS &amp;&amp;
tar -cJpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-10.0.tar.xz .</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Replace <code class="envar">$HOME</code> by a directory of your
          choice if you do not want to have the backup stored in <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code>'s home directory.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          7.14.3. Restore
        </h2>
        <p>
          In case some mistakes have been made and you need to start over,
          you can use this backup to restore the temporary tools and save
          some recovery time. Since the sources are located under
          <code class="filename">$LFS</code>, they are included in the backup
          archive as well, so they do not need to be downloaded again. After
          checking that <code class="envar">$LFS</code> is set properly,
          restore the backup by executing the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">cd $LFS &amp;&amp;
rm -rf ./* &amp;&amp;
tar -xpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-10.0.tar.xz</code>
</pre>
        <p>
          Again, double check that the environment has been setup properly
          and continue building the rest of the system.

            If you left the chroot environment either to strip off debug
            symbols, create a backup, or restart building using a restore,
            remember to mount the kernel virtual filesystems now again as
            described in <a class="xref" href="kernfs.html" title=
            "7.3.&nbsp;Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems">Section&nbsp;7.3,
            &ldquo;Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems&rdquo;</a> and
